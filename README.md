# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Susy, a passionate Data Analyst from Portugal. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I'm on a journey to explore the endless possibilities of technology, with a specific focus on data analysis and its impact on our lives. My deep interest in areas like predictive modeling, big data trends, machine learning, and data visualization fuels my constant learning and experimenting with new ideas and projects in these fields.

When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying family time, crafting or hikking, immersing myself in the beauty of the outdoors. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals.

## What You'll Find Here

In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a collection of projects and experiments that showcase my journey through the exciting world of Data Analytics. From delving into complex data sets to uncovering insights, I'm excited to share my journey in data analysis and the valuable lessons learned along the way.

Feel free to explore my projects, provide feedback, or reach out for collaboration. Let's make the world a better place, one line of code at a time!
